# Linux_file_system

# History of windows and Linux
→ there was an disk OS named ms dos
→ it worked on command line only
→ Windows was installed over ms dos
→ Windows assigned removable floppy drives alphabets; A,B,C
→ With the addition of hard disk, C drive became internal disk
→ Linux doesn't install application like windows
→ Follows UNIX traditions
→ It is case sensitive file structure
→ Mac’s background is also around UNIX, so its similar to Linux
→ File Hierarchy standard defines the structure and layout
